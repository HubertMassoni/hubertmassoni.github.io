Welcome to my academic website! 

I am a 3rd year PhD student in Economics at the University of Bologna, under the supervision of Profs. [Emanuele Campiglio](https://sites.google.com/site/ecampiglio/) and [Bruno Conte](https://brunoconteleite.github.io/), and an active member of the [ERC-SMOOTH](https://site.unibo.it/smooth/en) project.

My research is about Trade, Climate Change, and Production Networks.
